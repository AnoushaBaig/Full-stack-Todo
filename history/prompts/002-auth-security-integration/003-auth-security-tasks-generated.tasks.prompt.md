# Auth Security Tasks Generated

## User Intent
```
--title "Auth Security Tasks Generated" --stage tasks --feature 002-auth-security-integration
```

## My Response
Generated comprehensive tasks for the authentication and security integration feature, organizing them into phases by user story to enable independent implementation and testing. Tasks cover Better Auth setup, JWT configuration, frontend authentication flows, backend validation, and security enforcement.

## Outcome & Impact
Successfully created a complete task breakdown for the authentication and security integration feature with 25 specific implementation tasks organized across 7 phases. The tasks follow proper format with checkboxes, IDs, and file paths, enabling immediate execution by development team.

## Files Summary
- Created comprehensive tasks.md file with 25 implementation tasks
- Organized tasks by user story for independent development
- Included proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities
- Added MVP-first and incremental delivery strategy

## Tests Summary
none

## Next Prompts
- Begin implementation of Phase 1 (Setup) tasks
- Start with foundational authentication infrastructure (T001-T008)
- Proceed with user story implementations in priority order

## Reflection Note
The task breakdown enables incremental delivery starting with MVP functionality and progressing to complete authentication solution.

## Failure Modes Observed
None observed - all planning requirements successfully implemented

## Next Experiment to Improve Prompt Quality
N/A - successful completion of the required task breakdown
