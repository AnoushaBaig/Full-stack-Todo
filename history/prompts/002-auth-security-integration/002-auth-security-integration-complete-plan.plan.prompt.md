# Auth Security Integration Complete Plan

## User Intent
```
--title "Auth Security Integration Complete Plan" --stage plan --feature 002-auth-security-integration
```

## My Response
Completed the full planning phase for the authentication and security integration feature, including all required documentation: implementation plan, research findings, data models, API contracts, error contracts, quickstart guide, and implementation tasks.

## Outcome & Impact
Successfully completed comprehensive planning for the authentication and security integration feature. Created all necessary planning artifacts including implementation plan, research, data models, API contracts, error definitions, quickstart guide, and detailed task breakdown. The feature is now ready for implementation with complete specifications and contracts.

## Files Summary
- specs/002-auth-security-integration/plan.md - Implementation plan with 10 detailed steps
- specs/002-auth-security-integration/research.md - Research findings and decisions
- specs/002-auth-security-integration/data-model.md - Data models for auth entities
- specs/002-auth-security-integration/quickstart.md - Setup and usage guide
- specs/002-auth-security-integration/contracts/http-api.md - API contracts
- specs/002-auth-security-integration/contracts/errors.md - Error contracts
- specs/002-auth-security-integration/tasks.md - Implementation task breakdown

## Tests Summary
none

## Next Prompts
- Begin implementation of Better Auth configuration (T001-T003)
- Implement frontend authentication components (T004-T008)
- Implement backend JWT validation (T009-T013)

## Reflection Note
All required planning artifacts have been created following the spec-driven development approach, ensuring proper authentication and security implementation with Better Auth and JWT.

## Failure Modes Observed
None observed - all planning requirements successfully implemented

## Next Experiment to Improve Prompt Quality
N/A - successful completion of the required planning work with all artifacts created
